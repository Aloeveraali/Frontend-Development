    <p class="description" >Coraline (2009) is a stop-motion animated dark fantasy film directed by Henry Selick,
         based on Neil Gaiman's novella. It follows Coraline Jones, a young girl who discovers a 
         secret door in her new home, leading to an alternate, seemingly perfect world. However, this world is controlled by her sinister "Other Mother," who wants to keep Coraline there forever by sewing buttons into her eyes.
